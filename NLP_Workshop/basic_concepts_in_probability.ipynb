    "In this lab session we'll focus on implementing and computing basic concepts in probability. More specifically we'll focus on the following three rules from the probability theory:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Sum rule:**  \n",
    "$\\Large p(X) = \\sum_Y{p(X,Y)}$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Product rule (also known as the chain rule):**  \n",
    "$\\Large p(X,Y) = p(Y|X)p(X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The elements in the above equations are referred to as:  \n",
    "* $\\Large p(X,Y)=p(Y,X)$ - Joint probability\n",
    "* $\\Large p(Y|X)$ - Conditional probability  \n",
    "If two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent of each other then their conditional probability $p(X|Y)$ is the same as the marginal $p(X)$.  \n",
    "* $\\Large p(X)$ - Marginal or Prior probability  \n",
    "Under the sum rule this probability is known as the marginal probability since it is obtained by marginalizing or summing out the other variable (Y) in the joint probability $p(X,Y)$.    \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Bayes' Rule:**  \n",
    "$\\Large p(Y|X) = \\frac{p(X,Y)}{p(X)} = \\frac{p(X|Y)p(Y)}{p(X)}$  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Using the sum rule we could further expand the denominator in the Bayes' rule:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Large p(Y|X) = \\frac{p(X|Y)p(Y)}{p(X)} = \\frac{p(X|Y)p(Y)}{\\sum_Y{p(X,Y)}}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator in the Bayes' rule plays an important factor in that it makes sure that the probability values across all Y variables sum to one and therefore it is often referred to as the normalizing constant.  \n",
    "Bayes' rule plays an important role in machine learning. Under this theorem each probability component in the rule has a precise definition and it is referred to as: \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Large p(Y|X)$ - Posterior probability  \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Large p(X|Y)$ - Likelihood \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Large p(Y)$ - Prior probability  \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Large p(X)=\\sum_Y{p(X,Y)}$ - Marginalized likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "One fundamental use of this rule is in Bayesian model estimation where we have two random variable, the model $M$ and the data sample $D$. We are interested in the most probable model that explains the data:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Large argmax_M{p(M|D)} = argmax_M{\\frac{p(D|M)p(M)}{p(D)}}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is selected based on how well it explains the data sample $p(D|M)$ and in general how good of a model it is. The latter information is contained in the prior probability $p(M)$. The marginalizing constant doesn't play an important role in the process of finding the most suitable model as it is computed by marginalizing over all possible models. \n"
